-White Light/White Heat
Doug and Sally inside
They're cooking for the down pipe
Who're staring at Miss Rayon
Who's busy licking up the pigpen
I'm searching for my mainline

Doug and Sally inside
They cookin' for the Down Pipe
Who's staring at Miss Rayon
Who's busy licking off her Pig Pen
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Aw just like Sister Ray said
Whip it on.

Rosie and Miss Rayon
They're busy waiting for her booster
Who just got back from Carolina
She said she didn't like the weather
They're busy waiting for her sailor
Who's big and dressed in pink and leather
He's just here from Alabama
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar
I'm searching for my mainer
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Aw just like Sister Ray said
Lay it on him.

Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks it shoots it between three and four
He aims it at the sailor
Shoots him down dead on the floor
Oh you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet
Now don't you know you'll stain the carpet
And by the way have you got a dollar
On no man I haven't got the time-time
To busy sucking on a ding-dong
She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
Oh she does just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline

Ah do it do it just su-su-su-suck

Who's knocking at my chamber door
Now could it be the police
They come and take me for a ride-ride
Oh but I haven't got the time-time
Hey hey hey she's busy sucking on my ding-dong
